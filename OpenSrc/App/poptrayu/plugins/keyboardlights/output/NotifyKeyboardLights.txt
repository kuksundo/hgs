---------------------------------------
Keyboard Lights 2.0 Notification Plugin
---------------------------------------

Purpose:
--------
Keyboard Lights 2.0 uses the scroll-lock keyboard light to notify you of new
incoming emails. The configuration page allows you to select whether you'd 
prefer the scroll-lock light to flash or remain solid-on when you have new
emails. 

How To Use:
-----------
NotifyKeyboardLights.dll should be copied to the Plugins sub-directory
where PopTrayU is installed. Run PopTrayU, and on the Options screen, select
the "Plugins" category. Make sure "Keyboard Lights 2.0" is checked so that
the plugin will be running. Right click on "Keyboard Lights 2.0" and select
"Plug-in Options" to configure options for Keyboard Lights 2.0. Options will
be saved in PopTray.ini in the [KeyboardLights] section. 

Known Issues:
-------------
This plugin may incorrectly detect the PopTray.ini location if PopTray is run
with a command-line parameter to specify the settings folder. This should not
have any harmful side-effects, it just means the settings for this plugin will
not be in the location you might expect.

Credits:
--------
Keyboard Lights 2.0 was developed by Jessica Brown, building upon Renier 
Crause's "PopTray Example Plugins" version 0.6.
