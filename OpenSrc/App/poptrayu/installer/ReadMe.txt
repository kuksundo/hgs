PopTray
-------

PopTray is FREEWARE and OPEN-SOURCE !

PopTray started as a little POP3 mail checker I wrote, because I couldn't find a 
freeware program that had all the features I wanted. Since then, new features 
have been added by request, and everything has been refined a lot. Since PopTray 
version 2.0 it has now become a full-featured e-mail notifier, but keeping its 
ease of use.  PopTray 3.0 has a new XP look and supports plug-ins.  PopTray 3.1
added multi-row rules.

PopTray was written in Delphi 7.0 using the Indy internet components.
The source is available for download from the PopTray website.
