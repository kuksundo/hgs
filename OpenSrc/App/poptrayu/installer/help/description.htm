		<td class="info">PopTray started as a small POP3 mail checker written by Renier Crause. He wrote it because he couldn't find a freeware program that had
			all the features he wanted. Since that time, many new features have been
			added. After years of refinement PopTray
			has now become a full-featured, customizable, e-mail notifier,
			while still keeping it's original ease of use. In 2012, Jessica Brown forked the project to extend PopTray with additional features not available in the most recent release of PopTray, such as handling increasingly common UTF-8 emails more gracefully. The forked project is now called <strong>PopTrayU</strong> to avoid confusion of two products with identical names. </td>
