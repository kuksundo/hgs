				  <td class="light">If you are using a (third party) dark windows theme, you should enable the &quot;twilight&quot; scheme. This scheme changes the highlight color for toolbar buttons, and uses an alternate version of some images that will look better on a dark background (for example, images may use white instead of black as a foreground color). If you are using the standard Aero theme or another light colored windows theme, the &quot;Normal&quot; color scheme should be selected.</td>
