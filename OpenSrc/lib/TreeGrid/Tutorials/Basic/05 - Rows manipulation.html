            <li>
               Selected rows are shown by default in <b>yellow</b> background.<br />
               The selected rows can be deleted, moved or copied together. Or they can be used for any custom action, get them by API method <b>GetSelRows</b>.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
               One row can be selected or unselected by panel <b>Select</b> button or by <b>ctrl+click</b> or by pressing <b>space</b> key on focused row.<br />
               All rows can be selected or unselected by header panel <b>Select</b> button. If there are both selected and not selected rows, the rows are unselected.<br />
               Range of rows can be selected by <b>click</b> to the first row and <b>shift+click</b> to the last row. And by <b>ctrl+drag</b> rows.<br />
               All rows selection can be inverted by <b>ctrl+click</b> to the header panel <b>Select</b> button. Range of rows can be inverted by <b>dragging</b> panel <b>Select</b> buttons.<br />
               Rows can be selected and unselected also by <b>Search</b> feature, see tutorial <a href="../Filter/03 - Search and advanced filters.html">Search and advanced filters</a>.<br />
               Rows can be selected and unselected also by <b>API</b>, methods <b>SelectRow</b> and <b>SelectAllRows</b>.<br />

               The selected cells are not used by TreeGrid and can be used for custom actions, get them by API method <b>GetSelRanges</b>.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
               To permit selection only one row at time set &lt;Cfg> attribute <b>SelectingSingle='1'</b><br />
               To have not persistent selection, to clear it after some action or when selecting new selection attach action <b>ClearSelection</b> to given events.
               For example &lt;Actions OnClickCell='ClearSelection,FocusEdit' OnClickOutside='ClearSelection,Blur'/> to clear the selection after any click.
