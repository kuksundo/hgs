Functions GetIsValid and SaveData of TsdJFIFMarker and other classes
have minor bug - Magic array has type Char but in Delphi 2010 Char has
size of 2 bytes. And so GetIsValid always returns false and SaveData
always saves wrong segment signature. It will be good if you change
type of array to AnsiChar in next version of your excellent lib.
