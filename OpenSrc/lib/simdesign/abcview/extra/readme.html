<h2>Main Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Browse your folders, and select the ones you want to add to the database 
    collection easily by checking them. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>View up to 1 Million items at once in a list. View them as list, small icons, 
    large icons or thumbnails (resizable) in a modern browser. Memory management 
    and components are all focused on performance. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Sort items on name, date, size, folder, series, rating, etc. The sorting 
    algorithm is the fastest available (quicksort), and it uses fast binary compare 
    methods. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Randomize items in the list (ultra-fast). This means that you can still 
    use the normal &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;backward&quot; buttons in the 
    slideshow, even on randomized items. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Scan for files across directories, this allows you to add your collection 
    of files very easily. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Views all major types of files: JPEG, GIF, PNG, PSD, TIFF, BMP and many 
    others. The thumbnails of regular AVI videos show the first frame.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Enlarge or shrink your images to fit the screen size. This is done in a 
    very friendly way, by first doing a quick resize and then using a background 
    process to enhance the picture using Lazcos filtering. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Check for duplicates in the file list. This duplicate checker is one of 
    the fastest around, and can be started in the background while working with 
    the program. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Delete files safely. Each time you are about to delete files, ABC-View Manager 
    will prompt you with a dialog that contains information about your set of 
    selected files. You can opt to put the files in the recycle bin (default) 
    or into a ZIP archive or folder, or to delete the files without backup option.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Load and save your catalog files. Loading a catalog is usually much faster 
    than actually scanning the files using explorer. The items are stored very 
    efficiently using compression. No database is used, but an internal proprietary 
    memory-efficient structure. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Full internal drag/drop and OLE drag/drop support to and from explorer. 
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Full Shell-notification (whenever changes occur in the file system these 
    changes are updated automatically when ABC-View runs)<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Losless rotation, flipping and cropping of JPEG files by using lowlevel 
    operations on the JPEG's structure. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Email the selected files directly from the application. Auto-shrink the 
    images before sending. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Filter the items you want to see, filter by file type, file size, file date 
    and many other criteria. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>&quot;Build-a-Web&quot; helps you build web index pages of your images in 
    no time!</li>
</ul>
