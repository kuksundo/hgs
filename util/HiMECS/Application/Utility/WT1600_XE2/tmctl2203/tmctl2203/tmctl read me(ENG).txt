		int TmcSetRen( int id, int flag );

		Purpose:	Places a device in remote or local mode. Use with non-GPIB interfaces is limited to 
				YOKOGAWA instruments.
		Parameters:	int  id    device ID
				int  flag  remote (1)/local (0)
		Return value:	0 = OK, 1 = ERROR

		Details:
			Description of Parameters
			  int id
				Set this parameter to the ID of the device that will be placed in remote or
				local mode.
			  int flag
				Send 1 for remote, and 0 for local mode.

			Depending on the type of interface, there are some differences in the way this command
			is used.
			For GPIB, the REN line is set to TRUE or FALSE.
			Even after the parameter is entered, the device isn't actually placed in the mode until
			messages are sent to that device.
			With GPIB, the remote/local function cannot be applied separately to different devices.
			When using RS232, USB or Ethernet with YOKOGAWA 488.2 compliant devices, only devices
			that support COMMunications groups as messages can utilize this function.
			In this case, the function can be applied separately to different devices.
			In the USBTMC, remote / local switch is realized by control transfer.
		Example:
			int ret = TmcSetRen( id, 1 );

		---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				Set this parameter to the ID of the device from which an error number will
				be acquired.

			Returns the number of the last error that occurred on that device.
			If the return value from any of the functions is non-zero (including the initialization
			function), this function can be used to acquire the actual error number.
		Example:
			int ret = TmcSend( id, "START" );
			if( ret != 0 ) {
				int err = TmcGetLastError( id );
			}

		---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		int TmcSetTerm( int id, int eos, int eot );

		Purpose:	Sets the terminator for sending or receiving a message.
		Parameters:	int id    device ID
				int  eos  terminator
				int  eot  EOI
		Return value:	 0 = OK, 1 = ERROR

		Details:
			Description of Parameters
			  int id
				Set this parameter to the ID of the device for the terminator.
			  int eos
				Set this parameter to the terminator itself. The settings are shown below.
				eos = 0 : CR+LF
				    = 1 : CR
				    = 2 : LF
				    = 3 : EOI (GPIB), or not (RS232, USB, Ethernet)
				When the interface is GPIB and eos is 3, eot determines whether EOI is used.
			  int eot
				Set this parameter to determine whether EOI can be used for the terminator.
				This is a GPIB-specific command.

			Sets the terminator. In general, you can use the following settings for any interface
			when carrying out communications with YOKOGAWA products.
			   int ret = TmcSetTerm( id, 2, 1 ); /* eos = LF, eot = TRUE */
			When sending or receiving binary data with the setting eos = LF, if LF code is included
			in the binary code, the transmission concludes when the LF code is encountered.
			However, when receiving block data using a YOKOGAWA product, if you use
			"TmcReceiveBlockHeader" and "TmcReceivceBlockData", there's no need to switch the
			terminator.
			This function not supported with USBTMC on instruments other than the DL9000. It is not necessary to use the function.
		Example:
			int ret = TmcSetTerm( id, 2, 1 );

		---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		int TmcSetTimeout( int id, int tmo );

		Purpose:	Sets the timeout time for communications.
		Parameters:	int  id   device ID
				int  tmo  timeout time (100-6553600 ms)
		Return value:	0 = OK, 1 = ERROR

		Details:
			Description of Parameters
			  int id
				Set this parameter to the ID of the device on which timeout will be set.
			  int tmo
				Set this parameter to the timeout time in units of 100 ms.
				When tmo = 0
					GPIB:  Timeout unlimited
					Other: No timeout

			Sets the timeout time for communications. Generally you should set the timeout time
			to 30 seconds when using YOKOGAWA products. (Even if you lengthen the timeout time,
			performance will not be affected.
		Example:
			int ret = TmcSetTimeout( id, 300 );	/* 30s */

		---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		int TmcFinish( int id );

		Purpose:	Closes the connection to a device.

4.  Using the Library with Microsoft Visual Basic
	4.1  Configuration
		Files:	Tmctl.bas (file for definitions of functions)
			Tmval.bas (file for definitions of constants)
		- Copy Tmctl.bas and Tmval.bas to the standard module of the project you will be using.
		- Copy Tmctl.dll to the Windows system directory.
		- Copy ykusb.dll and YKMUSB.dll to the Windows System directory when using USB.
		- Copy USBTMCAPI.dll to the Windows System directory when using USBTMC (DL9000).

	4.2  Overview
		This library uses an initialization function to set up a connection between the PC and devices
		to be controlled. Then, values are returned as parameters and used as distinguishing IDs for 
		the connected devices. Those IDs can be passed to other functions (such as send/receive
		functions) to allow them to carry out their controls.

			includes binary data. If the end flag was set to 1, a terminator is sent at the end of
			the message. Therefore while the end flag is 0, the device side considers the message
			to be in a series.
		Example:
			Dim ret As Long
			Dim msg(10) As Byte
			
			ret = TmSendSetup( id )
			msg(0) = CByte(Asc("S"))
			msg(1) = CByte(Asc("T"))
			msg(2) = CByte(Asc("A"))
			ret = TmSendOnlyB( id, msg, 3, 0 )
			msg(0) = CByte(Asc("R"))
			msg(1) = CByte(Asc("T"))
			ret = TmSendOnlyB( id, msg, 2, 1 )

				Used with the GPIB, USB, Ethernet or USBTMC interface.
		Parameters:	Long id  device ID
		Return value:	1 = message to continue, 0 = message complete

		Details:
			Description of Parameters
			  Long id
				Set this parameter to the ID of the device from which the message to be
				checked for completion was received.

			When receiving a message that has been divided up into a series of messages,
			all of the message is received using "TmReceiveOnly", and "TmReceiveOnlyBin"

		TmSetRen(ByVal id As Long, ByVal flg As Long) As Long

		Purpose:	Places a device in remote or local mode. Use with non-GPIB interfaces is limited to YOKOGAWA instruments.
		Parameters:	Long  id    device ID
				Long  flg   remote (1)/local (0)
		Return value:	0 = OK, 1 = ERROR

		Details:
			Description of Parameters
			  Long id
				Set this parameter to the ID of the device that will be placed in remote or
				local mode.
			  Long flg
				Send 1 for remote, and 0 for local mode.

			Depending on the type of interface, there are some differences in the way this
			command is used.
			For GPIB, the REN line is set to TRUE or FALSE.
			Even after the remote parameter is entered, the device isn't actually placed in
			the mode until messages are sent to that device.
			With GPIB, the remote/local function cannot be applied separately to different devices.
			When using RS232, USB and Ethernet with YOKOGAWA 488.2 compliant products,
			only devices that support COMMunicate groups as messages can process this function.
			If your system complies, the function can be applied separately to different devices.
			In the USBTMC, remote / local switch is realized by control transfer.
		Example:
			Dim ret As Long
			ret = TmSetRen( id, 1 )

		---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		TmGetLastError(ByVal id As Long) As Long

		Purpose:	Returns the number of the last error that occurred.
		Parameters:	Long id  device ID
		Return value:	Error number

		Details:
			Description of Parameters
			  Long id
				Set this parameter to the ID of the device from which the error number
				is acquired.

			Returns the number of the last error that occurred on that device.
			If the return value from any of the functions is non-zero (including the initialization
			function), this function can be used to acquire the actual error number.
		Example:
			Dim ret As Long
			Dim err As Long

			ret = TmSend(id, "*IDN?")
			If (ret <> 0) Then
				err = TmGetLastError(id)
			End If

		---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		TmSetTerm(ByVal id As Long, ByVal eos As Long, ByVal eot As Long) As Long

		Purpose:	Sets the terminator for sending or receiving a message.
		Parameters:	Long id    device ID
				Long  eos  terminator
				Long  eot  EOI
		Return value:	0 = OK, 1 = ERROR

		Details:
			Description of Parameters
			  Long id
				Set this parameter to the ID of the device for the terminator.
			  Long eos
				Set this parameter to the terminator itself. The settings are shown below.
				eos = 0 : CR+LF
				    = 1 : CR
				    = 2 : LF
				    = 3 : EOI (GPIB), or not (RS232, USB, Ethernet)
				When the interface is GPIB and eos is 3, eot determines whether EOI is used.
			  Long eot
				Set this parameter to determine whether EOI can be used for the terminator.
				This is a GPIB-specific command.

			Sets the terminator. In general, you can use the following settings for any interface
			when carrying out communications with YOKOGAWA products.
				Dim ret As Long
				ret = TmSetTerm( id, 2, 1 )  'eos = LF, eot = TRUE
			When sending or receiving binary data with the setting eos = LF, if LF code is included
			in the binary code, the transmission concludes when the LF code is encountered.
			However, when receiving block data using a YOKOGAWA product, if you use
			"TmReceiveBlockHeader", "TmReceivceBlock", and "TmReceivceBlockB", there's no need to
			switch the terminator.
		Example:
			Dim ret As Long
			ret = TmSetTerm( id, 2, 1 )

		---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		TmSetTimeout(ByVal id As Long, ByVal tmo As Long) As Long

		Purpose:	Sets the timeout time for communications.
		Parameters:	Long id    device ID
				Long  tmo  timeout time (100-6553600 ms)
		Return value:	0 = OK, 1 = ERROR

		Details:
			Description of Parameters
			  Long id
				Set this parameter to the ID of the device on which timeout will be set.
			  Long tmo
				Set this parameter to the timeout time in units of 100 ms.
				When tmo = 0,
					GPIB: Timeout unlimited
					Other: No timeout

			Sets the timeout time for communications.
			Generally you should set the timeout time to 30 seconds when using YOKOGAWA products.
			(Even if you lengthen the timeout time, performance will not be affected.)
		Example:
			Dim ret As Long
			ret = TmSetTimeout( id, 300 )	'30s

		---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		TmFinish(ByVal id As Long) As Long
