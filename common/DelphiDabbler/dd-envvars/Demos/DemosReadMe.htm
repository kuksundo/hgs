<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  Two demo projects are distributed with the <em>Environment Variables
  Unit</em>. Each demo is available in both VCL and FireMonkey 2 versions.
</p>

<p>
  The VCL versions require Delphi 7 or later, while the FireMonkey 2 versions
  require Delphi XE3 or later.
</p>

<p>
  The demos may need minor changes in order
</p>

<p>
  Each demo project includes the <var>PJEnvVars</var> unit explicitly so there
  is no need to install it before using the demos.
</p>

<h2>
  Demo 1
</h2>

<p>
  Demo #1 can be found in the <kbd>Demos\1</kbd> directory, with the VCL and
  FireMonkey 2 versions being in the <kbd>VCL</kbd> and <kbd>FMX</kbd>
  sub-directories respectively.
</p>

<p>
  Both versions present a similar interface. They demonstrate every method of
  the <var>TPJEnvironmentVars</var> static class and show how to use the
  <var>TPJEnvVarsEnumerator</var> enumerator class.
</p>

<p>
  When run the program displays a set of controls on the left and an empty list
  box on the right of its window. The following buttons exercise the methods of
  <var>TPJEnvironmentVars</var>.
</p>

<dl class="indent">
  <dt>
    <em>GetValue()</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Gets the value of the environment variable whose name is in the
    <em>Name</em> edit box and displays it in the <em>Value</em> edit box. If
    the name is blank, or doesn't exist, or exists but has no value, the
    <em>Value</em> edit box is cleared.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>SetValue()</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Sets the value of the environment variable named in the <em>Name</em> edit
    box to the value entered in the <em>Value</em> edit box. If the environment
    variable doesn't exist it is created. If it does exist its value is updated.
    If the <em>Value</em> edit box is empty the environment variables value is
    cleared, but the variable still exists. If the <em>Name</em> edit box is
    empty an error message is displayed.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>Delete()</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Deletes the environment variable named in the <em>Name</em> edit box from
    the environment block. If the environment variable didn't already exist
    nothing happens. If the <em>Name</em> edit box is empty an error message is
    displayed.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>Expand()</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Expands the string value entered in the <em>Name</em> edit box and displays
    the result in the <em>Value</em> edit box. The entered string can contain
    any text. Environment variable names enclosed between two <kbd>%</kbd>
    characters are replaced with their values. Other text and invalid variable
    names are left unchanged.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>Exists()</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Displays a dialogue box informing if the environment variable named in the
    <em>Name</em> edit control exists in the environment block. Blank names are
    always treated as non-existent, event if there are actually some unnamed
    values in the environment block.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>Count()</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Displays a dialogue box that shows of the number of environment variables in
    the current environment block.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>BlockSize()</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Displays a dialogue box that shows the size of the current environment block
    <em>in characters</em>.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>GetAllNames(TStrings)</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Gets the names of all environment variables in the current environment
    block in <var>TStrings</var> format. The code behind the button updates the
    list box's <var>Items</var> property directly in the method call.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>GetAllNames: array</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Gets the names of all environment variables in the current environment block
    and returns them as a dynamic string array. The underlying code iterates the
    array and displays each name, enclosed between <kbd>[</kbd> and <kbd>]</kbd>
    characters, in the list box.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>EnumNames() - method</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Calls the <var>EnumNames</var> method, passing a form method as the
    callback. The callback method adds each enumerated environment variable name
    to the list box, with the name enclosed between <kbd>[</kbd> and
    <kbd>]</kbd> characters.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>EnumNames() - closure</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Calls the <var>EnumNames</var> method, passing an anonymous method (or
    closure) as the callback. This anonymous method adds each enumerated
    environment variable name to the list box, with each name enclosed between
    <kbd>&lt;</kbd> and <kbd>&gt;</kbd> characters.<br />
    <strong>Note:</strong> this button is disabled when the demo is compiled
    with a version of Delphi that does not support anonymous methods.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>GetAll(TStrings)</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Gets the names and values of all environment variables in the current
    environment block in <var>TStrings</var> format. The code behind the button
    updates the list box's <var>Items</var> property directly in the method call
    and displays the environment variables exactly as they are stored in the
    environment block.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>GetAll: array</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Gets the names and values of all environment variables in the current
    environment block and returns them as a dynamic array of
    <var>TPJEnvironmentVar</var> records. The underlying code iterates this
    array and displays each environment variable's name and value in the list
    box. Variable names are enclosed by <kbd>[</kbd> and <kbd>]</kbd> and are
    followed by the associated value enclosed in double quotes.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>EnumVars() - method</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Calls the <var>EnumVars</var> method, passing a form method as the callback.
    The callback method adds each enumerated environment variable name and value
    to the list box, with names enclosed between <kbd>[</kbd> and <kbd>]</kbd>
    characters and values enclosed by double quotes.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>EnumNames() - closure</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Calls the <var>EnumVars</var> method, passing an anonymous method (or
    closure) as the callback. This anonymous method adds the name and value of
    each enumerated environment variable to the list box, with each name
    enclosed between <kbd>&lt;</kbd> and <kbd>&gt;</kbd> characters and values
    enclosed by double quotes.<br />
    <strong>Note:</strong> this button is disabled when the demo is compiled
    with a version of Delphi that does not support anonymous methods.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <em>CreateBlock()</em>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Creates a new environment block containing the three environment variables
    listed below the button, and displays it in the list box. If the <em>Include
    current environment in new block</em> check box is ticked then the
    environment variables in the current block are included in the new block.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  Finally, the <em>Enumerate names using TPJEnvVarsEnumerator</em> button
  demonstrates the use of the <var>TPJEnvVarsEnumerator</var> class. Clicking it
  creates a <var>TPJEnvVarsEnumerator</var> instance and uses it to enumerate
  the names of all the environment variable in the current block. Each name is
  enclosed between <kbd>[</kbd> and <kbd>]</kbd> characters and added to the
  list box.
</p>

<h3>
  Compilation notes
</h3>

<p>
  How the projects are compiled depends on the version of Delphi in use, as
  follows:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Delphi 7
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Open and compile <kbd>Demos\1\VCL\VCLDemo1.dpr</kbd>.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Delphi 2005 and 2006
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Open and compile <kbd>Demos\1\VCL\VCLDemo1.bdsproj</kbd>.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Delphi 2007
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Rename <kbd>Demos\1\VCL\VCLDemo1.dproj.2007</kbd> as
    <kbd>Demos\1\VCL\VCLDemo1.dproj</kbd>, overwriting the original version.
    Now open and compile the renamed project.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Delphi 2009 to XE
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Open and compile <kbd>Demos\1\VCL\VCLDemo1.dproj</kbd>.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Delphi XE2
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Open <kbd>Demos\1\VCL\VCLDemo1.dproj</kbd>. This project can be built as
    either a 32- or 64-bit Windows application, but it only defines a 32-bit
    Windows target by default. So, to compile as a 32-bit application simply
    build the project as opened. To compile as a 64-bit application you must
    manually add a Windows 64-bit target to the project and re-build it.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Delphi XE3 and later
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      To compile the VCL version of the project open
      <kbd>Demos\1\VCL\VCLDemo1.dproj</kbd>. This project can be built as either
      a 32- or 64-bit Windows application, but it only defines a 32-bit Windows
      target by default. So, to compile as a 32-bit application, simply build
      the project as opened. To compile as a 64-bit application you must
      manually add a Windows 64-bit target to the project and re-build it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To compile the FireMonkey 2 project open
      <kbd>Demos\1\FMX\FMXDemo1.dproj</kbd>. This project comes with Windows
      32-bit and 64-bit targets pre-defined, with the 64-bit target as the
      default. Select the required target and (re)build the project.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>
  Demo 2
</h2>

<p>
  Demo #2 can be found in the <kbd>Demos\2</kbd> directory, with the VCL and
  FireMonkey 2 versions being in the <kbd>VCL</kbd> and <kbd>FMX</kbd>
  sub-directories respectively.
</p>

<p>
  Both versions demonstrate how to create child processes that have custom
  environment blocks that have been created by using the
  <var>TPJEnvironmentVars.CreateBlock</var> method.
</p>

<p>
  Each version of the demo consists of a project group containing two projects.
  The first, <kbd>Parent.dpr</kbd> compiles into a program that lets the user
  specify some custom environment variables that can be passed to a child
  process. More than one child process can be started. The second project is
  <kbd>Child.dpr</kbd> which implements the child processes that are started
  from <kbd>Parent.exe</kbd>. All the child process does is to display its
  environment block in its main window.
</p>

<p>
  To use the demo programs, proceed as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Open either <kbd>VCLDemo2</kbd> or <kbd>FMXDemo2</kbd> project groups, using
    whichever file extension suits your compiler.
  </li>
  <li>
    Compile both the <kbd>Parent</kbd> and <kbd>Child</kbd> projects.
  </li>
  <li>
    Run <kbd>Parent.exe</kbd>
  </li>
  <li>
    Edit, or add to, the suggested environment variable names listed in the
    large multi-line edit control. Enter each new environment variable in
    <kbd>Name=Value</kbd> format, one per line. If you enter duplicate values
    for the same environment variable then the value listed last is used.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tick the <em>Include current environment block</em> check box if you want to
    pass the current environment block, as well as the custom environment
    variables, to the child process. If this is done, and if there is a name
    clash between any variable in the current block and any of the new variables
    you entered in the edit control, the inherited value will be discarded and
    the new value from the edit control will be used.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the large button to start a child process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Review the environment variables displayed by the child process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat from step 4 as required.
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="pullout">
  <p>
    <strong>Warning:</strong> Some child processes require that certain
    environment variables are set to enable them to operate properly. Therefore,
    if you are not passing the current environment block to the child process,
    you may occasionally see unexpected behaviour.
  </p>
  <p>
    An example of this is in the FireMonkey 2 version of the project. The child
    application seems to require that the <kbd>SystemRoot</kbd> environment
    variable is set correctly. Failure to pass this environment variable to the
    child process can result in the process displaying a console window instead
    of its GUI. For this reason <kbd>SystemRoot</kbd> is displayed in the
    multi-line edit control as one of the suggested environment variables in the
    FireMonkey version.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  How the projects are compiled depends on the version of Delphi in use, as
  follows:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Delphi 7
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Open the <kbd>Demos\2\VCL\VCLDemo2.bpg</kbd> project group and build both
    projects.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Delphi 2005 and 2006
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Open the <kbd>Demos\2\VCL\VCLDemo2.bdsgroup</kbd> project group and build
    both projects.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Delphi 2007
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Rename <kbd>Demos\2\VCL\Parent.dproj.2007</kbd> as
    <kbd>Demos\2\VCL\Parent.dproj</kbd> and
    <kbd>Demos\2\VCL\Child.dproj.2007</kbd> as
    <kbd>Demos\2\VCL\Child.dproj</kbd>, overwriting the original versions. Now
    open the <kbd>Demos\2\VCL\VCLDemo2.groupproj</kbd> project group and build
    both projects.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Delphi 2009 to XE
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Open the <kbd>Demos\2\VCL\VCLDemo2.groupproj</kbd> project group and build
    both projects.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Delphi XE2
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Open the <kbd>Demos\2\VCL\VCLDemo2.groupproj</kbd> project group. The
    <kbd>Parent</kbd> and <kbd>Child</kbd> projects can be built as either 32-
    or 64-bit Windows applications, but each defines only a 32-bit Windows
    target by default. So, to compile both projects as 32-bit applications,
    simply build all the projects as opened. To compile either or both as a
    64-bit applications you must manually add a Windows 64-bit target to one or
    both projects and re-build the affected project(s).
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Delphi XE3 and later
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      To compile the VCL version of the project open the
      the <kbd>Demos\2\VCL\VCLDemo2.groupproj</kbd> project group. The
      <kbd>Parent</kbd> and <kbd>Child</kbd> projects can be built as either 32-
      or 64-bit Windows applications, but each defines only a 32-bit Windows
      target by default. So, to compile both projects as 32-bit applications,
      simply build all the projects as opened. To compile either or both as a
      64-bit applications you must manually add a Windows 64-bit target to one
      or both projects and re-build the affected project(s).
    </p>
    <p>
      To compile the FireMonkey 2 project open the
      <kbd>Demos\2\FMX\FMXDemo2.groupproj</kbd> project group. Both the
      <kbd>Parent</kbd> and <kbd>Child</kbd> projects come with 32-bit and
      64-bit targets pre-defined, with the 64-bit target as the default in both
      cases. Select the required target for each project and (re)build the
      affected project(s).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> In both the VCL or FireMonkey 2 versions of this
      demo you will get a compile error if the projects have different targets
      and you attempt to build the whole project group at once. To get round
      this problem just build each project separately.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>
  Deprecated Code
</h2>

<p>
  There are no demos for the deprecated <var>TPJEnvVars</var> component and
  public routines contained in the unit. Therefore <var>TPJEnvVars</var> does
  not need to be installed to use the demos.
</p>

<p>
  For the time being some demo code still exists in the <kbd>EnvVarsDemo</kbd>
  directory of the <em>Delphi Doodlings</em> Subversion repository on Assembla.
  You can see a list of the demo files at <a
    href="http://bit.ly/1mM1jLt"
  >http://bit.ly/1mM1jLt</a>. Subversion users can also checkout the files using
  the same URL. Please note this code is no longer maintained or supported.
