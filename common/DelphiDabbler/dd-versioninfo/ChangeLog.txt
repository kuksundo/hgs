  - CompareVerNums - compares two version number records.

Release v3.0 of 17 February 2002
+ Added ability to access all "translations" stored in a file's version information, rather than just first one. This has been done so that code using earlier versions of this component should continue to work unchanged.
+ Added new property to expose fixed file information record.

+ Added properties to return number of "translations" and to select index of "translation" to be used.
+ Added properties to return language and character set codes in addition to descriptive strings.
+ All string info, language and character set properties now return values from the currently selected translation (which defaults to the first translation maintaining backward compatibility).

Release v2.1 of 28 November 1999
+ Changed unit name from VerInfo to VInfo to allow component to install under Delphi 3 & 4 (VerInfo clashes with an existing unit in these versions).

Release v2.0.1 of 08 July 1999
+ Changed palette where component installs to "PJ Stuff" from "Own".
+ Added HTML documentation (shared documentation with Release 1.0.1).
+ Included 16 bit Version Information Component release v1.0.1
