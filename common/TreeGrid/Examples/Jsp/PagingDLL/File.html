	  <h2>Server side paging with DLL on XML file</h2>
	  <p><font size="2">
         This example demonstrates using <b>TreeGrid server side DLL/SO</b> library
            for server side <b>paging</b>, <b>calculations</b>, <b>grouping</b>, <b>sorting</b>, <b>filtering</b>, <b>Excel export</b> and <b>updates</b>.
         It demonstrates especially complex <b>grouping</b> feature and cell editing in various groups.<br>
         Layout is in <b>FileDef.xml</b>, data in <b>FileData.xml</b>. 
         Server side script serving data is in <b>File.aspx</b>. 
            This is file is universal and works on parameters sent from client and set in &lt;bdo> tag in this html file.<br>
         <i>This example does not use any custom JavaScript or server script code, 
            all features are set via XML data definitions and provided by TreeGrid!</i><br>
         <br>
         In table there are fictive resellers around the world with their results from the first two months in year 2004.<br>
         In columns <b>Registered</b>, <b>Since</b>, <b>Calls per</b> and <b>Rabat</b> are data related to partner 
            and can be edited only when rows are grouped by <b>Partner</b> (or by Location and Partner).<br>
         In columns <b>Orders</b>, <b>Income</b> and <b>Expenses</b> are results from every partner's month and can be edited in any grouping.<br>
         Column <b>Gross profit</b> is calculated (Income - Expenses), 
            <b>Discount</b> is calculated (Gross profit x Rabat) and
            <b>Profit</b> is calculated (Gross profit - Discount).<br>
         In bottom <b>Total results</b> row is summary of the results for whole table, 
            in individual group rows when the grid is grouped is summary for given group.<br>
         When are rows grouped by <b>Location and Partner</b> you can drag and drop partners to another location, 
            add new partner to the location or delete the partner. You can also change the whole location by choosing another.<br>
