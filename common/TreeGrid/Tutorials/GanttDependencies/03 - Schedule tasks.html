         See documentation for <b><a href="../../Doc/GanttCompute.htm#Correcting">Correcting dependencies</a></b> and <b><a href="../../Doc/GanttCompute.htm#Algorithm">Algorithm for correcting dependencies</a></b>.
      </li>
      <li>
         The correct dependencies are shown blue, the incorrect dependencies in red. The colors can be changed, see tutorial <a href="02 - Dependencies.html">02 - Dependencies</a>
      </li>
      <li>
         Attribute <h3>GanttIncorrectDependencies</h3> controls which dependencies will be marked as incorrect.<br />
         For 1 will be marked as incorrect only dependencies that start (+lag) before they end.<br />
         For 2 will be marked as incorrect all dependencies that don't start (+lag) and end on the same date.<br />
         For individual dependency it can be changed by <b>float</b> value in the dependency definition (after the !).<br />
     </li>
     <li>
      The dependencies are corrected by moving the related tasks. The tasks are never resized in this action. 
      The tasks are never moved to violate their constraints.<br />
      When moving task that consists from more parts, all the parts are moved together, preserving space (in worktime) between parts.<br />
      Only Gantt objects defined in <b>GanttTask</b> can have dependencies. 
     </li>
     <li>
      The dependencies can be corrected <b>manually</b> by clicking to the first button (Correct) on toolbar. <br />
      Or by choosing item "Correct all dependencies" or "Correct related dependencies" in the Gantt popup menu.<br />
      Or by calling the action <b>CorrectAllDependencies</b> or <b>CorrectDependencies</b> by API or assigned to some event.
     </li>
     <li>
      The dependencies can be corrected <b>automatically</b> (or by user confirmation) after any change in the chart (task move, resize, delete, create, constraint change or dependency change), according to <h3>GanttCorrectDependencies</h3> attribute value.<br />
      The one changed task can be also automatically corrected or it can be fixed and all other tasks are moved to correct the dependencies, it is controlled by <b>GanttCorrectDependenciesFixed</b> attribute. It affects task or dependency change, but not constraints change.
     </li>
     <li>
      There are <h4>three methods of correcting dependencies</h4>, chosen by <h3>GanttStrict</h3> attribute.<br />
      By default (for <b>1</b>) are all tasks moved as close to project start / end date as possible.<br />
      For <b>0</b> are the tasks moved as little as possible to only correct the dependencies.<br />
      For <b>2</b> are all descendant tasks moved as close as possible to their ancestors.
      See documentation for <a href="../../Doc/GanttCompute.htm#Algorithm">Algorithm for correcting dependencies</a>.
     </li>
     <li>
      A user can move the task manually and preserve this position when moving the task for correcting dependencies. The task is never moved before this manual date.<br /> 
      It is controlled by <b>GanttManual<i>X</i></b> and <b>GanttManualChange</b> for main bar and <b>GanttRunManual</b> and <b>GanttRunManualChange</b> for run bar.
     </li>
     <li>
      It is possible to schedule the tasks from project start or project finish, it is set by <h3>GanttDirection</h3>.<br />
     </li>
     <li>
      <h4>Circular dependencies</h4> checking is controlled by <h3>GanttCheckDependencies</h3>, it is possible to restrict, permit or ask the creating.<br />
      The tasks containing circular dependencies are usually impossible to correct.<br />
     </li>
     <li>
      By attribute <h3>GanttFixComplete</h3> is possible to fix all already started tasks (with Complete>0) and move only not yet started tasks (Complete=0).<br />
      In this case dependency between two already started tasks is always marked correct.
     </li>
     <li>
     <b>Disabled</b> and <b>locked</b> task is never moved when scheduling. <br />
     <b>Disabled</b> task has also disabled dependencies, they are not used when correcting dependencies.<br />
     </li>
     <li>
      If scheduling <b>Run box</b>, it is possible to move the box freely or preserve the box order or to not overlay the boxes by <b>GanttRunCorrectBox</b>.<br />
     </li>
     <li>
      In large charts when some dependencies still remain incorrect after correcting dependencies increase value of <b>GanttMaxCorrectingLoops</b>.<br />
      Increasing it can slow down correcting especially if the dependencies cannot be corrected due constraints or circular dependencies.<br />
