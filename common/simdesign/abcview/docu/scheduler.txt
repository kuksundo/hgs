Scheduler

abcview needs a scheduler

TTask
  property Status: 
   Idle
   Pending
   Running
   Completed
  property Priority: integer
  property EstimatedLoad: integer (load in ticks of the processor)
  property EstimatedMemWork: integer (in bytes)
  property EstimatedMemCompleted: integer (in bytes)
   
TScheduler
  Tasks[]: TTask
  Threads[]: TThread
  
  
The scheduler gets populated with tasks in the initialisation part.

When running in the main thread, the scheduler will select an idle task from the tasks pool based on 
the priority of all idle tasks, and starts a thread with this task.

The task must be atomic: if the thread seems to "hang", the task will be reverted by the scheduler and 
the scheduler resets the task to "idle". Then, at possibly another moment, the scheduler can select another 
thread to complete the task.

The scheduler is responsible for administration of the tasks[] list:
 the TTask.Status property
     TTask.Priority can be reprioritized
