Scene 3D:

The sdScene3D units have been designed in order to get info from a "commom denominator" from all 
CAD formats into the scene and underlying GLScene objects.

current formats

DXF
===
- Format:               sdDxfFormat
- Scene3D connection:   sdDXFToScene3D
- Viewer:               No, not yet with GLScene

DWG (AutoCad):
===
- Format:               sdDwgFormat
- Aux files:            sdDwgBitReader, sdDwgHeaderVars, sdDwgItems, sdDwgProperties, sdDwgTypesAndConsts
- Scene3D connection:   -
- Viewer:               No, not yet with GLScene

IGES:
====
- Format:               sdIGESFormat
- Aux files:            sdIGESEntities, sdIGESOpenGL, sdIGESPointlist
- Scene3D connection:   sdIGESToScene3D.pas
- Viewer:               yes, formats3d\iges\demo\IgsAnalyse.dpr

VRML:
====
- Format:               sdVrmlFormat
- Aux files:            sdVrmlNodeTypes
- Scene3D connection:   sdVrmlToScene3D
- Viewer:               Yes, formats3D\vrml\demo\VrmlViewer.dpr


Editor3D
========
- Started on 10jul2010
- Goal 1: make more generic than the vrml viewer demo, adding at least the formats DXF, DWG, IGES and VRML. 
- Goal 2: editing as well as viewing
- Goal 3: Make connections for solid modeling stuff, elasticity, gravity etc

The vrml viewer demo does still use objects from the sdVrmlFormat. Must create generic object references
in sdScene3D or sdScene3DBuilder so the editor can work with the formats in a generic way.
