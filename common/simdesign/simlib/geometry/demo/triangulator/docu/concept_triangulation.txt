For the N-dimensional triangulation there are some concepts, applying both to 2D and 3D.

Basic entities
==============

Minimum volume element (triangle/tetrahedon)
--------------------------------------------

2D: Triangle2D: 
- Triangle consisting of 3 vertices
- The 3 edges (lines) connect to other triangles (neighbours)
- A triangle edge line may be part of a segment (part of the boundary)
- Delaunay circle: the circle passing through the 3 vertices
- Delaunay property: no neighbour triangle points lay within the delaunay circle
- Area: 1/2 * (V2-V1) x (V3-V1)
- Normals: pointing out from the edges, unit length
  N1 = |(V2-V1) x (0 0 1)|
  N2 = |(V3-V2) x (0 0 1)|
  N3 = |(V1-V3) x (0 0 1)|
- Vertex angle: Each vertex corner occupies some part of the unit circle around the 
  vertex: arc part / total circumference on the unit circle. To simplify things, we
  use the cosine of the angle. 
- Smallest angle: smallest of the 3 vertex angles. 

3D: Tetra3D: 
- Tetrahedon consisting of 4 vertices
- The 4 edges (planes) connect to other tetrahedons (neighbours)
- A tetrahedon edge plane may be part of a segment (part of the boundary)
- Delaunay sphere: the sphere passing through the 4 vertices
- Delaunay property: no neighbour tetrahedon points lay within the delaunay sphere
- Volume: 1/6 * ((V2-V1) x (V3-V1)) * (V4-V1)
- Normals: pointing out from the edge planes, unit length
  N1 = |(V3-V1) x (V2-V1)|
  N2 = |(V3-V2) x (V4-V2)|
  N3 = |(V1-V3) x (V4-V3)|
  N4 = |(V1-V4) x (V2-V4)|
- Vertex angle: Each vertex corner occupies some part of the unit sphere around the 
  vertex: arc part / total circumference on the unit sphere. To simplify things, we
  use the product of the 3 cosines of the angles to the other vertices. 
- Smallest angle: smallest of the 4 vertex angles.

Vertex
------

2D: Vertex2D: a vertex is a point in space, defined by X and Y coordinate
3D: Vertex3D: a vertex is a point in space, defined by X and Y and Z coordinate

Quality Mesh
------------

2D: TriMesh2D: 
- Has list of vertices making up the (delaunay) triangles
- Has a list of triangles
- Has a list of steiner points (vertices) that are added for the quality mesh

3D: TetraMesh3D: 
- Has list of vertices making up the (delaunay) tetrahedons
- Has a list of tetrahedons
- Has a list of steiner points (vertices) that are added for the quality mesh

Boundary
--------

2D: Graph2D
- List of segments
- List of vertices

3D: Graph3D
- List of segments
- List of vertices

Segment
-------
2D: Segment2D
- This is a line, connected to two vertices

3D: Segment3D
- This is a *polyline*, connecting N vertices, defining a plane. For simplicity
  we assume now that this should always be a convex polyline of at least 3 points

Segment intersection
--------------------

2D: Inters2D
- This is a vertex, resulting from intersecting 2 Segment2D elements. It can be 
  reduced to nothing, in case the segments do not intersect.

3D: Inters3D
- This is a line, defined by two vertices, resulting from intersecting 2 Segment3D
  elements. It can be reduced to just a point, or nothing, in case the segments
  just touch, or do not intersect.
  

General concepts
================

Calculating delaunay circle/sphere
----------------------------------
2D:
3D:

Test: vertex above edge
-----------------------
2D: Ni x (P - Vi) > 0
3D: Ni x (P - Vi) > 0

Test: point in volume element
------------------------------
2D: 
- for each edge: point not above edge
- for each vertex: point on vertex (with tolerance)
- for each edge (line): point on edge (with tolerance)
Return "inside", "on edge", "on vertex"

3D:
- for each edge: point not above edge
- for each vertex: point on vertex (with tolerance)
- for each edge (plane): point on plane (with tolerance)
Return "inside", "on edge", "on vertex"

Body spit
---------
2D:
- Subdivide triangle T into 3 new triangles: T1, T2, T3
3D:
- Subdivide tetrahedon T into 4 new tetrahedons: T1, T2, T3, T4

Edge split
----------
2D: 
- Triangle T1, T2 and shared edge line E
- Subdivide T1 into T11, T12
- Subdivide T2 into T21, T22
3D:
- Tetrahedon T1, T2 and shared edge plane E
- Subdivide T1 into T11, T12, T13
- Subdivide T2 into T21, T22, T23

Delaunay swap
-------------
2D: Triangle swap
- Two triangles, V1V2V3 and W1W2W3, we assume that V1 and W1 are not on the shared edge.
- Swap to two new triangles
  T1: V1V2W1
  T2: W1W2V1
- Also hook up new neighbours and change segment pointers accordingly

3D: Tetrahedon swap
- Consider 6 vertices P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6
- Consider 4 tetrahedons T1, T2, T3, T4
  T1=P1P2P3P4
  T2=P5P3P2P4
  T3=P1P3P6P4
  T4=P5P6P3P4
- We want to swap T1 so it will include vertex P5 (opposite of T1's P2P3P4 edge plane)
 (these checks were done before:
  - Diagonal P3P4 should not have any other connecting tetrahedons
  - Vertices P1, P2, P5, P6 should project on P3P4)
- We can swap the diagonal P3P4 to diagonal P1P5
  T1=P1P2P3P5
  T2=P5P1P2P4
  T3=P1P3P6P5
  T4=P5P6P1P4
- Also hook up new neighbours and change segment pointers accordingly

Check swap
----------
2D:
- for each edge line:
  - edge not part of segment?
  - if yes.. triangle neighbour?
  - if yes.. all triangle points projects *on* diagonal (not above/below)
  - if yes.. return ok
3D:
- for each edge plane:
  - edge not part of segment?
  - if yes.. tetrahedon neighbour?
  - if yes.. find other tetrahedons sharing the diagonal to be swapped
  - if yes.. only two other tetrahedons?
  - if yes.. all tetrahedon points project *on* diagonal (not above/below)
  - if yes.. return ok

Add segment
-----------
2D:
- Find triangle chain connecting from segment vertex V1 to V2
- Test: any of the triangles references a segment that intersects our segment?
  Yes: Split segments, remove current segment and add new split segments to the list, exit
- More than one triangle? Swap triangles in chain until no triangle edges intersect our segment
- Add segment reference to triangles that connect V1 and V2
- Check all swapped and removed triangles in chain for delaunay
3D:
- Find tetrahedon chain connecting from segment vertex V1 to V2

Delaunay triangulation
----------------------

- Start with enough volume
  2D: rectangle consisting of 4 vertices and 2 triangles, large enough to
      contain all vertices
  3D: parallelipedum consisting of 8 vertices and 12 tetrahodons, large enough to
      contain all vertices
- Add all vertices from the graph, split a body or edge appropriately. 
  - New vertex "inside": split body
  - New vertex "on edge": split edge
  - New vertex "on vertex": do not add new vertex, signal to graph that this one is replaced by old
- Check newly added volume elements for delaunay, swap if necessary
  - for each edge: opposite point of connecting element in delaunay circle/sphere? 
  - if yes.. check swap
  - if ok: do delaunay swap
  - if swapped: add all new neighbours to list which must be checked as well
  - keep on checking/swapping until list has no more elements

Constrained triangulation
-------------------------

- for each segment in list: Add segment. The list can grow, because segments may be split and new
  parts added to the end of the list.

Sphere through 4 points:
